If we could see tomorrow, what of your plans?
No one can live in sorrow, ask all your friends
Times that you took in stride, they're back in demand
I was the one who was washing blood off your hands

Don't you cry tonight
I still love you, baby
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry tonight

I know the things you wanted, they're not what you have
With all the people talking, it's driving you mad
If I was standing by you, how would you feel
Knowing your love's decided, and all love is real?

Don't you cry tonight
I still love you, baby
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry tonight
